My job was to develop a backend pipeline to digitise a largely offline part of the company's operations and to analyse the consolidated data to suggest ways of improvement.\nThe work culture is quite good, people were very helpful and the office was great (especially the food;)). As an intern you may feel like the work load is a lot for 2 months but that is how the process is designed.\nI learnt how to use real world datasets to make usable solutions.",

    "domain": "Aerospace Core",
    "company": "Gulfstream Aerospace",
    "preparation": "I had my 2nd year Summer Internship at HEMRL lab of DRDO in Pune, where I had made the use of SolidWorks and Ansys for the purpose of my project, I had also done an SLP under Prof. Dhwanil Shukla in my 4th sem, which again had an extensive use of CAD for the purpose of modeling an e-VTOL, moreover I was in Team Rakshak as a design engineer during that time, which also equipped me with the necessary skill set of CAD, simulations and manufacturing. So eventually, being proficient in certain CAD softwares was central for me to be technically sound for the profiles which they had come for.",
    "resumeLink": "",
    "source": "Placement Cell",
    "approach": "Gulfstream had opened it’s IAF around middle of October (2024), via the placement cell, to which I had applied, and got shortlisted for their final interview round based on my resume, after which I had prepared enough for the interviews, enhancing my communication skills, English vocabulary and certain expected HR related questions, which ultimately got me selected for their final cohort of interns in 2024.",
    "stages": "Generally there are 3 stages for the selection process, the first 2 being solely on the resume and technical skillset, they prepare an interim set of students from all those who apply, after which they match your resume with the profiles for which they come for, and shortlist you for the interviews accordingly (may be for more than one profile as well), eventually selecting a group of final interns based on the interview performance. I would suggest to get indulged into all those kinds of projects/internships which equip you with the necessary skillset, mostly focused around CAD/simulations, since it is the most required one for most of their profiles, in order to crack the first 2 rounds. Secondly, I’d also suggest to prepare a set of highly expected HR questions for the interview part, taking help from the seniors, be ready to explain any of the project if asked during the interview, and also try to minimize the fumbleness if any during communication, since the interview round according to me is more or less concerned with how well you communicate with them.",
    "experience": "I was selected for the completions engineering profile, where I had to work on the design modifications for all sorts of aircraft interiors for their business private jets such as ledge club group assembly, thresholds, tablet/monitor holder assemblies, etc, for the purpose of reducing the amount of engineering and increasing versatility by meeting diverse customer demands.\n\nRegarding the work culture, I’d say I found it pretty much overwhelming in terms of treating all their employees equally irrespective of the hierarchy and their position in the company, fixed working hours, recreational activities by their HR group and also by the team members such as potlucks, professional development sessions, lean six sigma, etc.\n\nMy main takeaways from this internship would be definitely the skills which I had learnt there during the training period and also their application, key American cultural exposure and most importantly a typical experience of the corporate dynamics, which will for sure help me in my future to make my decision to choose amongst the industry sector and academia after I complete my grad school.",

    "domain": "Logistics",
    "company": "FedEx",
    "preparation": "I think they filtered out my resume because it had a mix of tech and non tech experiences. I was primarily inclined towards working in tech domain so I done many many tech projects and one research intern under Prof. Dhwanil (Aerospace Engineering), but I also had the PoRs of Internship Coordinator and DAMP mentor which I believe suited their role. In addition to this, I think the GD shortlist was very aero heavy, atleast for my profile. So that might also have contributed to me getting shortlisted for GD.",

    "experience": "My internship was in the network planning division of FedEx and the office was in Mumbai itself. With a few hiccups in the beginning, primary related to the issue of laptops and what project we were to be assigned to (my department had hired interns for the first time and they were not sure about what work could be assigned to us), we worked on 2-3 projects at once in the beginning but eventually settled to one later on. I had one co-intern in my department from our campus who is from aerospace only and we worked with managers in Mumbai as well Delhi and Dubai Offices of FedEx (Mumbai is the headquarters for the Indian region while Dubai is for the MEISA region).\n\nOur work primarily was around data centralization. Basically, FedEx being a huge organization, generates a lot of data, but the data flow was not streamlined and there was a lot of redundancy atleast in our department (Network Planning) whose primary job was to design a transporation network to meet the demand forecasted by the marketing department. So we ended up creating an app for the team using Power Apps and created an entire flow of data for the backend and even deployed it at the end. In addition to this, we also created Power BI dashboards on top of the centralized data we had created.\n\nThe work culture was very nice and friendly. Full timers got 2 WFH. The lead engineer whom we worked under was in delhi, so we never got to meet him but he was very supportive and encouraged us to take the challenges head on (neither of us had any background in creating apps or data flows, so had to learn everything from scratch and ChatGPT definitely helped). We ended up making a lot of friends and we are still in contact with some of them including our lead engineer.\n\nSpeaking about the takeaways, I think it was a very enriching experience for me particularly as it was my first corporate intern. I learned a lot about how big corporates work and function. We had a lot of field trips as well including those to warehouses where we understood how are parcels actually processed. We also visited the airport twice and got to see the on ground logistics of loading and unloading an airplane from as near as it can possibly get (plus we got an entire tour of the mumbai airport inside a FedEx car which was exhilarating as a plane spotter).\n\nOverall, I would say it was one of the best experiences of my college life and gave me a lot of perspective.",

Though to highlight some, I had taken up courses regarding fluid mechanics, like AE 667 (rotary aerodynamics), AE 244 (low speed aerodynamics), AE 339 (high speed aerodynamics), AE 152 (introduction to flight).\n\nI had an opportunity to work under Prof. R.K. Pant regarding Blimps, where I had co-authored a research paper published in an international conference. This immensely boosted my motivation to pursue research in aerospace.\n\nAlso my brief stint at IITB Racing team helped me apply those principles in real life, strengthening my core knowledge. This enabled me to take on any fluid mechanics related project, across any domains, be it aerospace or thermal fluid dynamics.",

    "stages": "Since I had externally applied, it was the sole discretion of the professor to take me in the project or not. Your first impression matters the most, that is the email which you would send to the professor. Make it as polished and precise as possible.\n\nIn my case, the professor asked for a brief small interview, mainly discussing my past projects, and how do I see to apply myself to the project proposed. My tip would be to just be yourself, and do a thorough background research of the professor's work. Curate your points according to those, and try to pitch yourself in the best way possible of how your past projects are aligned to the proposed research topic.",
    "experience": "My role was to mainly to develop a code on the Basilisk program (its an open-source CFD solver, just like OpenFOAM) to capture the process in which bubble entrapment takes place on same liquid-liquid drop impact surface. I had to uncover the patterns of the entrapped bubble size, its shape, its depth of entrapment, and various other parameters, and come up with a plausible explanation using capillary wave theory and vortex shedding concept.\n\nThe environment was very conducive for performing research in areas especially where there hasn't been much work done. My professor was very supportive, and helped me shape my thoughts and ideas into reality (basically to come up with a reasonable theory). On top of this, I had great lab-mates, which made the experience enjoyable on a whole another level (Who said French people are rude? They are one of the sweetest I have known!). It's really one of your best times in life, where you get to stay in a major city like Paris for longer period of time, that too being a student.",
