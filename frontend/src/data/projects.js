      learning: 'We did a lot of literature reviews, because we are making something very foundational in deepL, I got the chance to spend enough time understanding how deepL was initiated and I replicate the experiments for our network. I personally think before my BTP my entire experience with ML or Computer vision was way too theoretical, my work with prof. Prabhu gave me chance to make things more application based, we did hundreds of experiments with a lot of tweaking and iterations and brain storming over why things are not going the way we expect. It gave me a taste of how actually research is done unlike just going through what works and what not in course curriculums',

Deadlines are chill, and weekly meets. In my case, my project topic has been his topic of interest in past, so he seems genuinely interested in the project which makes thing even better. He is one of the profs who are really passionate about what they do, one can easily sense it on having a conversation with him.",

      impact: "The project is still ongoing so I can't say much, but this project is mostly about exploring a different way of doing wing morphing with a goal to alleviate gust effects, we don't know how this will pan out eventually, that what were are trying to see, if it turns out well and the things assumed in the project can be practically made, then it may have an impact in MAV industry sometime later, as such direct impact, no.",

Performed Numerical Analysis (MATLAB based, 2D inviscid) to optimize design of CCR intake with a deflected cowl showing Self-starting characteristics, improved performance parameter such as pressure losses and compression ratios, and better operability, meaning higher margins from unstart of engine. Second half of the project involved study of starting characteristics of High-Enthalpy Flows, which is generally the case in real flights. It involved writing a solver for calorically IMPERFECT gas. Later, I focused on validating this findings with CFD results (steady + transient simulations).",
      profExperience: "Working with Professor Sinha is a great experience, but it's a specific style you need to get used to. Don't expect him to hand you a ready-made project topic or tasks. Instead, you'll need to dive deep into the existing research yourself to find a gap that no one has filled yet. The weekly group meetings are where everything comes together. All the PhD, MTech, and BTech students are there. It’s an awesome chance to see what everyone else is working on, present your own progress, and get hit with critical questions and great suggestions from the whole group and professor. Here you also decide plan of action for the coming week. The process is really iterative. You start with lots of papers, then you begin running simulations. Bit by bit, week by week, you build on what you've learned. Slowly, a clear and solid research project just... shapes itself out of the foundational work.",
      learning: "We are all fascinated to CFD, and mostly to the cool looking contours, but don't underestimate the power of simpler numerical analysis. It's not about replacing CFD, but about being smarter. By using numerical models to understand the core physics first, you can see the big picture and save immense time and computing costs, making your CFD work far more focused and effective. So, overall it gave me a new perspective towards research.",
