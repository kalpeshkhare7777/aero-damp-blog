      preparation: 'Maintained a high CPI and built a strong research profile through projects at IITB. Reached out to professors at Stanford whose work aligned with my interests. My Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letters of Recommendation (LORs) were crucial.',
      experience: 'I worked at the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL) on uncertainty quantification for autonomous systems. The research was highly theoretical and involved a lot of coding in Julia. It was a great preview of graduate student life and solidified my decision to pursue a PhD.'
